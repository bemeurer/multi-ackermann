# A fast, multithreaded, C++  Ackermann calculator

This is not really meant to have any use, I just thought it would be cool to
 make. It's still very much a WIP, so don't expect the title claims to be true
 necessarily, check the TODO category down below to make sure.

## Files

*   `ack.cpp` - The main file containing the calculator

## Dependencies

*   [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
*   [GMP](https://gmplib.org/)

## TODO

*   Have a simple Ackermann base code - :white_check_mark:
*   Implement arbitrary precision - :clock4:
*   Implement parallelism - :x:
*   Optimize code - :x:

<sub>:white_check_mark: - Done, :clock4: - On the works,  :x: - To do</sub>
